The STMicroelectronics BlueNRG-2 is a low power Bluetooth® smart system 
on chip, compliant with the Bluetooth® v4.1 specification and supporting 
master, slave and simultaneous master-and-slave roles.


HARDWARE
This project can be used with the STMicroelectronics BlueNRG-2 development 
platform (order code: STEVAL-IDB008V1).

The STEVAL-IDB008V1 board provides a set of hardware resources for a wide 
range of application scenarios: sensor data (accelerometer, pressure and 
temperature sensor), remote control (buttons and LEDs) and debug message
management through USB virtual COM port. 


DEBUG
The ST-LINK_gdbserver can from v4.0.2 program and debug BlueNRG-2 devices.


SOFTWARE
The BlueNRG-1 Development Kit Software, available from STMicroelectronics,
provides a Bluetooth low energy binary library with a complete set of APIs 
and related events callbacks allowing to interface with the Bluetooth low 
energy features offered by the BlueNRG-1 and BlueNRG-2 devices. It also 
includes a complete set of peripheral drivers (header and source files) 
allowing to interface to the device peripherals and a complete set of 
related demonstrations applications (header and source files). These 
examples contains prepared examples for Atollic TrueSTUDIO. 
The BlueNRG-1 Development Kit Software can be downloaded from:

INFO
The Atollic TrueSTUDIO Terminal view can be used to receive and send 
messages from/to the board when the Virtual COM port is used. Please see
the "Hello World" project available in the BlueNRG-1 Development Kit Software.
